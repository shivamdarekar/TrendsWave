dom ->Jab bhi koi HTML page browser me load hota hai, browser us HTML ko ek JavaScript object tree me convert karta hai — isi tree ko kehte hain DOM.
jiske through hum JavaScript se page ke elements ko read, change, ya interact kar sakte hain.

Virtual DOM
⚙️ React kya karta hai:
Pehle Virtual DOM banata hai (ye real DOM ka copy hota hai, lekin memory me)
Jab koi state ya data change hota hai, React compare karta hai old Virtual DOM vs new Virtual DOM
Sirf difference wale parts real DOM me update karta hai (efficiently!)
